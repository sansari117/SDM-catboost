# SDM-catboost

This repository implements Species Distribution Models (SDMs) using CatBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm particularly well-suited for handling complex, non-linear relationships and heterogeneous environmental predictors.

The workflow covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and variable importance.
